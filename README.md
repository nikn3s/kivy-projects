# learning-kivy

16/12/2022
Today, I began journey with Kivy. I always wanted to create a mobile or windows app. Although, Android Studio is great for android app development, I don't really enjoy using GUI. It is just me, or Android Studio's interface is a bit messed up? Like, it is confusing when you attempt to open a project, and add various items, the process of importing it and inserting to the app is unclear. It works way better when you use both, xml file and xml interface to add elements. It was a bit off topic, anyway.
What I learnt so far in Kivy:
  > Different layouts including GridLayout and Box Layout
  > Basics of how to use add_widget() function
I also encountered an error, but could easily fix it (I forgot to add brackets after return className'()' )
